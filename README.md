# From Figma: Digital Agency

## Essence
It's a landing page build from Figma based on website design ['Digital Agency - Landing Page'](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1117815114206690225).

### Used stack and tools:
* HTML5 (+ accessibility, SVG-sprite);
* CSS3 (+ flex, grid), SASS (SCSS);
* JS (+ ESMA6, RegExp, Intersection Observer API);
* BEM methodology;
* Git, Webpack, npm manager;
* Babel, Autoprefixer and other packages;
* pixel-perfect, desktop-first, adaptive web design, cross-browser.

### Improvements and developments (due to the original design):
* added modal window with a Contact Form for "Contact us" buttons, full data validity check before submitting the Form and sending form to me, Yanka_InCode, through [Formspree](https://formspree.io/);
* created style of page preloading animation, header on the scroll, open menu for mobile version, version of the website for tablets, selection of interactive elements.
